Based on the provided scripts, I'll outline a clear path to harden the Linux server. Let's break this down into structured steps:

Initial Setup and Basic Hardening:

# First, run the initial setup script with required ports (e.g., SSH port 22 and any other essential services)
sudo bash 01-setupInstallHarden.sh 22 80 443

This will:
- Install essential security tools (fail2ban, UFW)
- Create backup of critical directories
- Configure UFW (firewall) with specified ports
- Update system packages


User Management and Access Control:

# Get baseline of authorized users
sudo bash getAllUsers.sh

# Set up continuous monitoring for unauthorized users
sudo bash ensureCorrectUsers.sh

# Rotate SSH keys and passwords for additional security
sudo bash 03-passwordAndSSHRotate.sh

# Remove unnecessary user crontabs
sudo bash 06-eraseAllUserCrontabs.sh


Process and Service Monitoring:

# Install and configure process monitoring
sudo bash 08-pspy.sh

# Set up Snoopy logger for command logging
sudo bash 09-snoopy.sh

# Start continuous monitoring for reverse shells
sudo bash pkillBash.sh

System Hardening:

# Configure SSH security settings
sudo bash 07-ssh.sh

# Remove dangerous SUID binaries
sudo bash 05-suid.sh

# Set up system services monitoring
sudo bash 04-systemdServices.sh

# Run additional hardening with NixArmor
sudo bash 10-runWaseemNixArmorFork.sh

Persistence Hunting:

# Check for potential backdoors and suspicious files
sudo bash 11-enumeratePersistence.sh

# Run context script to get complete system inventory
sudo bash 12-context.sh
