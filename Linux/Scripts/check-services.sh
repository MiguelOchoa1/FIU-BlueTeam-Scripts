# Warning: Its required for the system to have systemd running to use this script, won't work with WSL.

# Purpose: Check Linux services for potential security issues by analyzing:
# - Services running as root
# - Services with unusual file permissions
# - Services with binaries in non-standard locations
# - Services with missing binaries
# - Services with world-writable executable paths
# - Services that are listening on network ports

# Define colors

GREEN='\033[0;32m'
YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
NC='\033[0m' # No Color
